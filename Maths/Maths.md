# MATHS

-   if we use left-shift operator such that the leftmost bit becomes the set bit(i.e. = 1), then that number will be perceived as negative number
-   XOR of a number with itself = 0 and XOR of any number with 0 is that number itself
-   **Modular Arithmetic**
    -   (a+b) % m = (a%m + b%m) %m
    -   (a-b) % m = (a%m - b%m) %m
    -   (a*b) % m = (a%m * b%m) %m
    -   (a/b) % m = (a \* (inverse of b if exists)) %m
